Project Description
Title: Java Client-Server Banking Application

Overview:
This project is a banking system simulation that operates over a client-server model. It uses Java socket programming to enable communication between clients and the server. The application allows users to register, log in, manage their accounts, perform transactions, and view their transaction history. It also includes functionalities for transferring funds between accounts and updating user information.

Key Components:

ServerThread: Manages individual client connections and handles server-side communication.
Requester: Acts as the client-side application to communicate with the server.
Client: Represents a user account with attributes like name, email, password, and transaction history.
Clients: Manages a collection of Client objects, including functionalities to add new clients and check login credentials.
User, Provider, Users: Additional classes that likely manage specific user details, services, and collections of users or providers.


Ensure secure network conditions.

Notes:
The application likely operates in a simulated environment and is not intended for real-world financial transactions.
There is a lot of room to improvement in the code, like validation, etc.
